__Mini apps are web apps built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript that can be discovered and used within Farcaster clients.__


## Why Mini Apps?

Mini Apps enable developers to distribute native-like apps to Farcaster users. They are the easiest way to deliver engaging, high-retention, and easy to monetize applications:

- Ship Fast - Go from idea to users in hoursâ€”no app store reviews. Build with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and use the Mini App SDK to deliver native-like apps.

- Get Discovered - Social feed discovery puts users just 1-click away and viral growth mechanics are built in. Users can find new applications through Mini App stores.

- Retain Users - Mobile notifications re-engage users by bringing them back when something new to do. Users can save their favorite Mini Apps so they are always a click away.

- Transact Seamlessly - An integrated Ethereum Wallet provides permissionless financial rails. Users can send money, buy art, or donate in a single click.

- Build Social - Users are signed into Mini Apps without forms or passwords. Leverage Farcaster's rich social data to create engaging social experiences.
